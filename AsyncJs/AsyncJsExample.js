console.log("end of script")

/* 

In this example, the setTimeout method executes a function after a specified time. The function passed to setTimeout will be executed asynchronously, which means that the program will continue to execute the next line of code without waiting for the timeout to complete


In JavaScript, asynchronous programming can be achieved through a variety of techniques. One of the most common methods is the use of callbacks.
